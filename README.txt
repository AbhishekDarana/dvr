I have been using  python 3.12

1)Open terminal

2)Change directory to the location of the python file.

3)Run command "python dvr4.py <Input text file with the adjacency matrix>"

Input text file has a specific format-
Each row must be given in the form of a list in python
 Example- [0,1,2,0,0]

network1.txt, network2.txt are examples of input files
